# Hipster Code Meetup app

The purpose of the app is to create a Meetup board.
A meetup organizer can add an event with a particular topic and a date of the meetup.
Users then can view that information, RSVP for the event, and see the count of attendees.
The organizer has admin rights, so he/she can add events, delete RSVPS and view names of attendees.
